                If you’ve ever taken a yoga or meditation class, had an energy healing session like 
                reiki, or just watched 
                online videos about those subjects, you’ve no doubt heard about chakras and the role
                 they play in the flow of energy in your body.

                You may have also learned that it’s important to keep your chakras open, or unblocked.
                
                But what exactly are chakras and how do they affect your physical and emotional well-being?
                
                In this article, we’ll take a closer look at your main chakras. We’ll also help explain the 
                impact these energy centers may have on your mind and body, plus how to keep them “open” in 
                order to promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being.
                What are chakras?
                
                In Sanskrit, the word “chakra” means “disk” or “wheel” and refers to the energy centers in
                 your body. These wheels or disks of spinning energy each correspond to certain nerve bundles
                  and major organs.
                
                To function at their best, your chakras need to stay open, or balanced. If they get blocked,
                 you may experience physical or emotional symptoms related to a particular chakra.
                
                There are seven main chakras that run along your spine. They start at the root, or base, of
                 your spine and extend to the crown of your head. That said, some people believe you have at 
                 least 114 different chakras in the body.
